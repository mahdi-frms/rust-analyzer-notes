# Rust Analyzer Notes

these notes are based on the Explaining Rust Analyzer series videos. Relying solely on the notes for understanding Rust Analyzer is not totally sufficient, and for getting a grasp on the project, you should see the videos.
you can watch the series from the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhb66M_x9UmrqXhQuIpWC5VgTdrGxMx3y)

## Note

I personally believe that videos that are mostly involved with coding (like mini-rowan video) do not require notes, as everything is fully explained and there's really nothing to be mentioned in the notes. In case you have another opinion about these videos, feel free to let me know in the issues.

## Contribution

if you've found issues in the notes, simply open an issue in this repository. also if you feel they lack some piece of information and important points described in the video, make a PR for that.
