# Rust Analyzer Notes

these notes are based on the Explaining Rust Analyzer series videos. Relying solely on the notes for understanding Rust Analyzer is not totally sufficient, and for getting a grasp on the project, you should see the videos.
you can watch the series from the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhb66M_x9UmrqXhQuIpWC5VgTdrGxMx3y)
